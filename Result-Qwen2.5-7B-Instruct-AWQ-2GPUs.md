Based on the provided text, **TmAlphaFold** is a database designed to evaluate and visualize the likely orientation of alpha-helical transmembrane protein structures predicted by AlphaFold2 (AF2). Here are the key points about TmAlphaFold:

1. **Purpose**: TmAlphaFold complements the limited number of experimental structures for alpha-helical transmembrane proteins by providing 3D predictions for thousands of new transmembrane protein structures.

2. **Methodology**:
   - **TMDET Algorithm**: TmAlphaFold uses the TMDET algorithm to detect the membrane plane in AlphaFold structures and their fragments. TMDET is a simple geometry-based method that visualizes the likely position of the membrane plane.
   - **Parameter Calculation**: Several parameters are calculated to evaluate the location of the protein into the membrane, allowing TmAlphaFold to assess the structural correctness of the predicted 3D models.

3. **Database Content**:
   - Contains 215,844 TM proteins.
   - Reconstructs the membrane bilayer using coordinates from PDB files and Predicted Aligned Error files.
   - Provides a web interface to visualize the likely orientation of TM proteins relative to the membrane plane and mark detected geometric errors.

4. **Quality Assessment**:
   - Evaluates the quality of predicted structures based on ten commonly seen problems, such as signal peptides, short helical segments, and low-reliability segments falling into the membrane bilayer.
   - Categorizes structures as excellent, good, fair, poor, or failed based on quality checks.

5. **Web Interface**:
   - Allows users to search for proteins using UniProt ID, accession, gene name, or protein name.
   - Provides various tabs for visualizing the AlphaFold2 structure, reconstructed membrane plane, quality assessments, and downloadable data.

6. **Strengths**:
   - Various filtering techniques help highlight potential membrane domains.
   - Helps in identifying and correcting errors in the orientation of TM segments relative to the membrane plane.

7. **Limitations**:
   - Does not consider the quaternary structure of proteins.
   - May fail to predict the correct orientation of TM segments in complex structures or those with unusual amino acid compositions.
   - Not equipped to handle structures with no reliable experimental template.

In summary, TmAlphaFold is a valuable resource for evaluating and understanding the predicted transmembrane protein structures generated by AlphaFold2, providing both visual and quantitative assessments of their accuracy and orientation relative to the membrane.
