Based on the text, TmAlphaFold is a database aimed at membrane-localized proteins, specifically focusing on alpha-helical transmembrane proteins. It is based on the AlphaFold2 prediction method. Here are the key points:

1. **AlphaFold2**: TmAlphaFold uses AlphaFold2 to predict the 3D structures of transmembrane proteins. AlphaFold2 is known for its highly accurate structure predictions.

2. **Database Content**: TmAlphaFold contains a large dataset of transmembrane proteins (215,844 TM proteins) with predicted structures and membrane orientations. 

3. **Quality Assessment**: The database includes methods to assess the quality of the predicted structures, such as detecting membrane planes and identifying alpha-helical regions.

4. **Visualization and Tools**: TmAlphaFold provides tools to visualize the predicted structures and reconstructed membrane planes. It also allows users to filter and explore the data based on various criteria.

5. **Integration of AlGORITHMS**: TMDET (a simple geometry-based method) is used to detect the most likely position of the membrane plane. Additional parameters are calculated to evaluate the localization of proteins within the membrane.

6. **Coverage and Updates**: The database is regularly updated with new structures and incorporates advancements in machine learning algorithms. It aims to cover a wide range of proteomes, providing better coverage for TM proteins compared to other resources.

In essence, TmAlphaFold leverages AlphaFold2 to predict and assess the structures of transmembrane proteins, enhancing our understanding of these important biological entities.
