 TmAlphaFold is a database for membrane localization and evaluation of AlphaFold2 predicted alpha-helical transmembrane protein structures. It uses the TMDET method to visualize the likely position of the membrane plane and calculates various parameters to evaluate the location of the protein into the membrane, allowing for an assessment of the structural correctness. The TmAlphaFold database can be accessed at [https://tmalphafold.ttk.hu/](https://tmalphafold.ttk.hu/). The database was created by Laszlo Dobson, Levente I. Szekeres, Csongor Gerd´an, Tam´as Lang´o, Andr´as Zeke and G´abor E. Tusn´ady from the Protein Bioinformatics Research Group and the Structural and Computational Biology Unit at the European Molecular Biology Laboratory.
