 TmAlphaFold is a database that provides 3D predictions for alpha-helical transmembrane proteins based on the AlphaFold2 (AF2) algorithm. The database also includes a tool to visualize the likely position of the membrane plane using TMDET, a geometry-based method. It also calculates several parameters to evaluate the location of the protein into the membrane. This allows TmAlphaFold to show whether the predicted 3D structure is realistic or not. The database is available at <https://tmalphafold.ttk.hu/>.
