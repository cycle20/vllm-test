 TmAlphaFold is a database that helps to evaluate the predicted 3D structures of alpha-helical transmembrane proteins using AlphaFold2 (AF2). It applies a method called TMDET to reconstruct the membrane plane and calculates parameters to evaluate the location of the protein in the membrane. This allows the TmAlphaFold database to show whether the predicted 3D structure is realistic or not. It is available at [https://tmalphafold.ttk.hu/](https://tmalphafold.ttk.hu/) and the manuscript discussing the methodology was published in Nucleic Acids Research, [10.1093/nar/gkac928](http://dx.doi.org/10.1093/nar/gkac928).
