1. **Purpose**: The primary goal is to facilitate the visualization and assessment of the likely orientation of 215,844 alpha-helical transmembrane proteins concerning the membrane plane.

2. **Methodology**:
   - **Topology Prediction**: Uses the Consensus Constrained Topology Prediction (CCTOP) method.
   - **Fragmentation**: Slices large structures into smaller parts for easier analysis.
   - **Detection of Membrane Plane**: Utilizes TMDET (Transmembrane Detection Engine) to identify the membrane plane.
   - **Evaluation Parameters**: Calculates various metrics like Root Mean Square Deviation (RMSD) and quality scores to assess the realism of the predicted structures.

3. **Database Structure**:
   - Contains 215,844 TM proteins.
   - Approximately 94% of these proteins have their membrane bilayers reconstructed.
   - Includes comprehensive data on membrane orientation and quality assessment.
   - Provides tools for downloading individual structures, assemblies, and topographical data.

4. **Features**:
   - Visualizes the membrane plane and detected errors.
   - Offers a downloadable version with rotated structures, TMDET results, evaluations, and topology predictions.
   - Allows customization of charts showing quality, organisms, TM segments, and CCTOP evidence levels.

5. **Strengths**:
   - Comprehensive coverage of membrane proteins.
   - High-quality predictions from AlphaFold2 algorithm.
   - Automatic segmentation and identification of membrane regions.

6. **Limitations**:
   - Requires careful handling of membrane predictions due to high sensitivity but moderate specificity.
   - Manual curation is needed for some cases.
   - Handles only single-pass membrane proteins and avoids including complex or unmodeled TM forms.

Overall, TmAlphaFold serves as a valuable resource for researchers studying membrane proteins, offering detailed visualizations and assessments of their structural properties.
